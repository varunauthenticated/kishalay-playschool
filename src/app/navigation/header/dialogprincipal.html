  <p style="text-align: justify;">
      A child of kindergarten is very tender and playful .At the same time children are naturally curious and eager to learn from their surroundings. They are active learners and keen listeners. Educators and psychologists refer to play as serious work of childhood. As children play, they clarify information, integrate ideas from previous experiences, explore and experiment with their environment.
      Thus we here at KISHALAY are making learning experience more exciting, safe and loving to your toddlers. Our kind and sincere staff members are always there to guide your child to build a wonderful tomorrow
